Hi! I'm Sandy, @thesandywatson. I'm here to learn Git and how GitHub works. I'm doing that as part of a process of learning how to build a website.

I'm also interested in learning more about MarkDown, HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, Bash, Vim, and plenty of other things. This short list is already too long. Focusing on any one thing would probably be better.

I'm interested in collaborating on almost anything, though I don't know how long I'll need till I'm qualified to collaborate on anything.

You can reach me by email at sandyscode@protonmail.com, or find me on Mastodon (a)sandywatson(a)mastodon.social
First thing to learn about Markdown: why does it assume my Mastodon address is an email address, and how do I correct it?
