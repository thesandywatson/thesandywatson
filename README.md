Hi! I'm Sandy, @thesandywatson. I'm here to learn Git and how GitHub works. I'm doing that as part of a process of learning how to build a website.
I'm also interested in learning more about HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript, Bash, Vim, and plenty of other things. This short list is already too long. Focusing on any one thing would probably be better.
I'm interested in collaborating on almost anything, though I don't know how long I'll need till I'm qualified to collaborate on anything.
You can reach me by email at sandyscode@protonmail.com, or find me on Mastodon @sandywatson@mastodon.social
